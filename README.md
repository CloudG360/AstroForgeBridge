# AstroForgeBridge
I used this with an internal SpongeForge-based plugin "AstroItemLib" to destroy and place blocks from the plugin (Using the player-based methods that handled drops) cause hooks for that aren't implemented. 

This is not a good nor elegant way to handle it but it works. :)
Now archived along with the [AstroItemLib](https://github.com/CloudG360/AstroItemLib) project.
